# Project Airos Use Cases

Project Airos is an **open-source AI Agent OS** designed to run on client devices (phones, PCs, wearables, and edge devices).  
To showcase its potential, we highlight **two flagship applications**:

1. 🕶️ **Smart Glasses Agent** (inspired by Meta Aria & Google Astra)  
2. 🎓 **AI for Education Tutor**

## 1. Smart Glasses Agent

### Vision
Lightweight smart glasses that combine **voice-first AI** and **vision Q&A** with strong privacy guarantees.

### Features
- **Voice-first interaction:** wake word, ASR (Whisper/FunASR), TTS (PrimeSpeech).  
- **Vision Q&A:** capture a photo, ask "What does this say?" → send image + query to cloud/edge LLM.  
- **Local-first:** VAD, wake word, and short-term memory on-device.  
- **Privacy by design:**  
  - Hardware shutter for camera.  
  - LED indicator during mic/cam use.  
  - User memory is local and portable.

### Architecture (simplified)
[Mic/Camera] --> [Device Runtime: VAD + ASR + WakeWord] --> [Airos Agent Core] -->
|--> Local Memory (short-term)
|--> Edge/Cloud LLM (multimodal)
<-- [TTS Response] <-- [Voice back to user]


### Example Flow
1. User says: "Hey Airos, translate this sign."  
2. Glasses capture a photo.  
3. Image + text query sent to LLM (cloud/edge).  
4. LLM returns translation.  
5. TTS generates response and speaks it back.

## 2. AI for Education Tutor

### Vision
A **Socratic AI tutor** for STEM subjects — available on phones, PCs, or school servers — designed for privacy and equal access.

### Features
- **Socratic method tutoring:** guided questioning, not direct answers.  
- **Adaptive learning:** tracks progress, misconceptions, mastery.  
- **Portable memory:** local storage of student history, shareable with teachers if permitted.  
- **Hybrid deployment:**  
  - On-device for individuals.  
  - On-prem edge servers for schools to ensure privacy.  
- **Multi-modal support:** text, voice, diagrams.

### Architecture (simplified)
[Student Input: Voice/Text] --> [Airos Agent Core] -->
|--> Local/Edge Memory (learning history)
|--> LLM (cloud/edge) for reasoning
<-- [Tutor Response: Voice/Text/Diagram]

### Example Flow
1. Student asks: "Why is the sky blue?"  
2. Airos agent checks student’s grade level + memory (past lessons).  
3. Chooses Socratic-style hints:  
   - "What happens to light when it passes through air?"  
   - "Do shorter or longer wavelengths scatter more?"  
4. Student responds → AI adapts hints → builds deeper understanding.  
5. Teacher dashboard shows misconceptions & progress (optional).

## Why These Two Use Cases?

- **Smart Glasses**: futuristic, tangible hardware demo → shows Airos in wearables.  
- **Education Tutor**: high social impact → demonstrates Airos in real-world learning.  

Together, they prove that **Airos is both innovative and practical**.

## Next Steps for Contributors

- Prototype **voice-first agent** using Airos runtime + ASR/TTS.  
- Build **vision Q&A pipeline** (photo → LLM → response).  
- Develop **education demo agent** with guided-question prompts + local memory.  
- Help design **APIs for device integration** (smart glasses, PCs, phones).
