    <h1>Why Project Airos exists</h1>
    <p>
      We believe AI should be sovereign: user-controlled, transparent, and available on devices people already own. Project Airos
      blends frontier research like Meta’s Project Aria with open-source values and community co-creation.

      <h2>The challenge</h2>
      <p>
        AI ecosystems today are cloud-only, gated by proprietary APIs, and designed to capture data. This model leaves
        individuals, educators, and smaller labs without privacy, agency, or affordability.
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div><strong>Vendor lock-in:</strong> Closed platforms shape the rules and pricing.</div>
        <div><strong>Data risk:</strong> Personal context and sensor feeds must leave the device to become useful.</div>
        <div><strong>Equity gap:</strong> Emerging markets and public institutions can’t rely on always-on connectivity.</div>

      <h2>Our response</h2>
      <p>
        Airos is a modular Agent OS that runs locally or at the edge. It empowers builders to orchestrate voice, vision, and
        context-aware intelligence with open tooling.

        <div><strong>Local-first:</strong> Keep computation and memory on trusted hardware whenever possible.</div>

      <h2>What makes Airos different</h2>
      <p>
        Meta’s Project Aria showed how rich sensor suites can power advanced AR experiences, yet the stack remained closed. Airos
        takes the inspiration and opens the blueprint: from the voice loop to the memory fabric, every layer is built to be
        forked, audited, and remixed.
